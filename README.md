#### Vera Molnar examples

This is a group of [p5.js](https://www.p5js.org) sketches which recreates a program by [Vera Molnar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r)'s which traces lines along the vertices of a grid.  They are ordered in increasing complexity and include simple sketches demonstrating the [map](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map) and [lerp](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/lerp) functions.
